# Book A Dine 

The Project aims to provide a seamless and efficient platform for customers to make reservations at their favorite dining establishments. Through an intuitive user interface, customers can browse available tables, select their desired time slot, and confirm their booking with ease. The system streamlines the reservation process for both customers and restaurant staff, enhancing the dining experience for all parties involved. By leveraging modern technology and innovative features, the project aims to revolutionize the way people dine out, making restaurant reservations convenient, reliable, and hassle-free
I'm trying to deepen my knowledge about Laravel, especially about relationships between tables. By creating this repository, I hope to deepen my knowledge of SQL and Laravel.
